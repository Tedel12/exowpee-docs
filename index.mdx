# Welcome to Exowpee API

**Exowpee API** is the complete solution to automate and centralize the management of your business.

This documentation covers **all endpoints** needed to integrate our platform into your applications, whether you're building a mobile app, a custom dashboard, an e-commerce frontend, a POS system, or connecting with third-party tools (accounting software, delivery partners, marketing platforms, etc.).

Built with developers and businesses in mind, the API is:
- **Multi-tenant** (each company has isolated data)
- **Secure** (JWT Bearer authentication)
- **Scalable** (from a single shop to a group with multiple branches)
- **Well-documented** (beginner-friendly examples + full OpenAPI spec)

## What is Exowpee used for?

Exowpee is a modern, multi-tenant ERP platform designed specifically for African businesses. It centralizes everything you need to run a retail, wholesale or service business efficiently:

- **Catalogue**  
  Products, variants (sizes, colors, storage…), categories, dynamic pricing, vendors, locations

- **Stock**  
  Multi-location inventory, stock transfers, regularizations, low-stock alerts, real-time tracking

- **Orders**  
  Customer orders, quotes, status tracking (pending → approved → shipped → completed), credit sales

- **Purchases**  
  Suppliers management, purchase orders, partial deliveries, procurement workflow

- **Accounting**  
  Automatic ledger entries, sales & cost tracking, basic double-entry ready for expansion

- **Identity & Teams**  
  Multi-company support, user roles & permissions (RBAC), branches hierarchy, profile switching

- **Reports**  
  Sales analytics, best sellers, low stock, credit overview, product activity

Built for scalability: from a single shop with 50 products to a group with multiple branches, warehouses, and companies.

|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Production    | `https://api.exowpee.com/v1`        | Bearer JWT         | Live environment – real customer data      | Production apps, live integrations    |
| Development   | `http://localhost:8000/v1`          | Bearer JWT         | Local Laravel server (php artisan serve)   | Development, testing, debugging       |
| Staging       | `https://staging.api.exowpee.com/v1`| Bearer JWT         | Pre-production (if available)              | Final QA before going live            |

**Important** — Always use **HTTPS** in production. Never expose tokens or credentials in client-side code.

## Quick start – 3 steps to get going

### 1. Get an authentication token

Most endpoints are protected. Start by logging in to obtain a Bearer JWT token.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exowpee.com/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@exowpee.com",
    "password": "yourpassword"
  }'
```

**Expected successful response (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

- `access_token`: Copy this value — it's your key for all protected requests
- `token_type`: Always "bearer"
- `expires_in`: Token lifetime in seconds (usually 3600 = 1 hour)

**Tip**: Save the token in Postman as a collection variable (`{{token}}`) or in your code securely.

### 2. Use the token in all requests

Add this header to **every** protected API call:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.exowpee.com/v1/catalog/categories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Try a simple endpoint – list your categories

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.exowpee.com/v1/catalog/categories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected response** (example):
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "39WgVV5nQL8KpD8LldXsHnUKkrW",
      "title": "Smartphones",
      "handle": "smartphones",
      "sort_order": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "39XabcdeFgHijKlMnOpQrStUvWx",
      "title": "Accessories",
      "handle": "accessories",
      "sort_order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Congratulations! You’ve just made your first authenticated API call.

**Next steps**  
→ Read the full [Authentication Guide](/authentication) to understand tokens, permissions, multi-company context, and refresh strategy  
→ Explore the [Modules](/modules) to understand each feature in detail  
→ Jump directly to the [API Reference](/api-reference) for full endpoint specs

## Important security & best practices

- **Never expose tokens** in client-side JavaScript (mobile/web frontend). Use backend proxy or short-lived tokens.
- **Always validate responses** (check for 401/403 and refresh token if needed).
- **Use HTTPS everywhere** in production.
- **Respect rate limits** (not yet documented — coming soon).
- **Test in development first** before touching production data.
